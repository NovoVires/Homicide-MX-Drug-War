How realiable are Mexican Homicide Statistics
================================================

There are 2 main sources of homicide statistics in Mexico, the vital
statistics from the INEGI and the police data which are available at
the ICESI (a civic association not affiliate with the
government). Since both are available at the state level you can
compare them and see if there are any differences.
Data are also available from PAHO and the UN, but only at the national level, so I also compared them.

Output
------
* Chart of homicides rate according to the INEGI, ICESI, PAHO, and the UN Crime Survey
* Scatter plot of the different homicide data (INEGI vs ICESI). That is see if the police records (labeled ICESI) match those of the vital statistics system(labeled INEGI). The police records are missing over 1,100 homicides in Chihuahua alone.
