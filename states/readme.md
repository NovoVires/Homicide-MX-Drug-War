Homicide in Mexico at the State Level
=====================================
* Maps and charts with the homicide rate at the state level
* Maps and charts with the change in homicide rate from 2006 to 2008
* If you run combine.bat you get a merged chart of the bar plots and maps
* A small multiples chart with the murder rate of each state from 1990 to 2008

ToDo
----
fix the iconv function which for some reason converts Michoacán into
Michoac!}n, maybe it's Emacs or whatever. I harcoded the state number
belonging to Michoacán which is ugly.
