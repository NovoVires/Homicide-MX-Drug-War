__Executions__

I used [Engauge](http://digitizer.sourceforge.net/) to scan the Figure "Ejecuciones By Month and Year, Jan. 2007- Feb. 2010" from the JUSTICE IN MEXICO PROJECT [Monthly News Report, Number 53](http://www.justiceinmexico.org/news/pdf/justiceinmexico-march2010news-report032410.pdf) March 2010

Notes:

The data from _Reforma_ looks like it's missing 1600 executions in Chihuahua, supposedly there were only 2000 executions in Chihuahua during 2009, but in this same period there were 2600 murders in Ciudad Juárez alone, normally there used to be about 200 homicides in Juárez, so I find it implausible to claim there were 2000 executions in the whole state. According to _Milenio_ there were 3000 executions, so I just added the missing executions before performing the linear regression.
