__Executions__

I used [Engauge](http://digitizer.sourceforge.net/) to scan the Figure "Ejecuciones By Month and Year, Jan. 2007- Feb. 2010" from the JUSTICE IN MEXICO PROJECT [Monthly News Report, Number 53](http://www.justiceinmexico.org/news/pdf/justiceinmexico-march2010news-report032410.pdf) March 2010

Notes:

The data from _Reforma_ looks like it's missing 1600 executions in Chihuahua, supposedly there were only 2000 executions in Chihuahua during 2009, but in this same period there were 2600 murders in Ciudad Juárez alone, normally there used to be about 200 homicides in Juárez. The data from _Milenio_ looks better, but it seems to be missing about 200 executions during the month of november.
