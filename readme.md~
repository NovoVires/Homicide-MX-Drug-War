Homicide in Mexico
=========================================================
Homicides in Mexico have increased greatly since the government started a drug war in December 2006. These series of scripts explore various statistics related to homicides in Mexico. You'll probably want to read the associated blog post at [blog.diegovalle.net](blog.diegovalle.net)

Requirements
------------
* You'll need to download a map of Mexico from the [ICESI](http://www.icesi.org.mx/estadisticas/estadisticas_encuestasTablas.asp)
* You'll also need to download two maps of Mexico at the state and county level from the [INEGI](http://mapserver.inegi.org.mx/data/mgm/). You'll need to register to do download them and they have to be version 3.1.1 or they won't work
# Áreas Geoestadísticas Estatales y Zonas Pendientes por Asignar (6.47 Mb)
# Áreas Geoestadísticas Municipales y Zonas Pendientes por Asignar (30.6 Mb)
* Edit the file maps-locations.r with the locations of the maps you downloaded!
* Imagemagick if you want to merge the state level homicide rate maps with the bar plots

Contents
--------
In the directories you'll find:

* accidents-homicides-suicides: Estimates the homicide rate for all of Mexico based on accidental and violent death data from the INEGI. As a bonus it includes the suicide and accident rates.
* county-maps: Choroplots of the murder rate by county in Mexico for the years 1990, 1995, 2000, 2006-2008
* county-months: Pretty graphics of the effect on the murder rate of involving the army in the drug war
* historic: Plot the Mexican homicide rate from 1990 to 2009 and compare it with that of the US, and England and Wales. And figure out if there how thrust-worthy the Mexican statistics are.
* conapo-pop-estimates: Estimates done by the CONAPO of the population of Mexico at the state level for the period 1990-2008
* states: Pretty plots and maps of the homicide rate at the state level

Data Sources
------------
Data Sources: Website of the [INEGI](http://www.inegi.org.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/proyectos/continuas/vitales/bd/mortalidad/MortalidadGeneral.asp?s=est&c=11144) for the
murder rate and [census data](http://www.inegi.org.mx/inegi/default.aspx?c=9260&s=est) for the years 1990, 1995, 2000 at the county level
[CONAPO](http://conapo.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=125&Itemid=203)
for population estimates at the national level (1990-2030), state level (1990-2030) and county level(2005-2030).


Output
-------
historic:

* A png chart of the homicide rate in Mexico
![homicide rate in Mexico]()
* A png chart of the homicide rate in Mexico, the US, and England and Wales


accidents-homicides-suicides:
* csv files with the rates of accident, homicides and suicides

states:
* Maps and charts with the homicide rate at the state level
* Maps and charts with the change in homicide rate from 2006 to 2008
* If you run combine.bat you get a merged chart of the bar plots and maps
* A small multiples chart with the murder rate of each state from 1990 to 2008

Notes
-----
Where possible I tried using the official population estimates from the CONAPO, but for some of the Choroplots (1990, 1995 and 2000) I used census data at the county level.
